//C++ pointer and reference difference 
Pointers can point nowhere ( NULL ), whereas reference always refer to an object. 

Pointers: A pointer is a variable that holds memory address of another variable. A pointer needs to be 
dereferenced with * operator to access the memory location it points to.

References : A reference variable is an alias, that is, another name for an already existing variable.
 A reference, like a pointer is also implemented by storing the address of an object.
A reference can be thought of as a constant pointer
