Ans: DNS stands for Domain Name System. It is a Naming System for all the resources over Internet 
which includes Physical nodes and Applications. DNS is a way to locate to a resource easily over a 
network and serves to be an essential component necessary for the working of Internet.

It is always easy to remember xyz.com that to remember its IP(v4) address 82.175.219.112. The condition 
gets more worse when you have to deal with IP(v6) address 2005:3200:230:7e:35dl:2874:2190. Now think of 
the scenario when you have a list of 10 most visited resource over Internet? Didnâ€™t the things get more 
worse to remember? It is said and proved scientifically that humans are good in remembering names as 
compared to numbers.

The Domain Name System functions to assign Domain Names by mapping corresponding IP addresses and works 
in a Hierarchical and Distributed Fashion.
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services,
 or any resource connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information 
 with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates 
 more readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for the purpose of locating and 
 identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols. By providing a worldwide,
  distributed directory service, the Domain Name System is an essential component of the functionality of 
  the Internet, and has been in use since the 1980s.
