Positive Experience
Difficult Interview
Application
I applied through a recruiter. The process took 3 weeks. I interviewed at Facebook.

Interview
A recruiter contacted me. After confirming that I would like to interview for the position,
 I was asked basic questions around networking, Linux system administration, and programming. 
 A graduating Computer Science student should expect to pass this with little difficulty.

Next was a phone interview for programming. I was asked to take input text and identify the 
unique words in the text and how many times each word occurred. 
Edge cases were important as was the performance.
 Interviewer asked for an analysis of the run-time and memory usage. 
 Any second-year CS student should have no problem completing this in far less than the allocated time.

Next was a phone interview for systems administration. I was given the bare minimum information
 possible about a system and told to describe how I discover running services and potential issues. 
 As I progressed, the interviewer gave me information reasonable based on my descriptions and identified
  when I had correctly discovered a problem or possible problem. In investigating problems, 
  it was important to be specific about why the problem was occurring and how to address the issue. 
  When addressing problems, the performance, scalability, and maintainability of the solution was very 
  important. Be prepared to identify how a file system is mounted or if it's local, and be prepared 
  to encounter a single central share mounted by many servers with active read/write activity 
  from them all. This will be difficult for anyone without good real-world Linux systems administration
   experience.
