Overriding: same method name same parameter
Overloading: same method name different parameter
1)
Method overloading is used to increase the readability of the program.
Method overriding is used to provide the specific implementation of the method that is already provided by its super class.

2)
Method overloading is performed within class.
Method overriding occurs in two classes that have IS-A (inheritance) relationship.

3)
In case of method overloading, parameter must be different.
In case of method overriding, parameter must be same.

4)
Method overloading is the example of compile time polymorphism.
Method overriding is the example of run time polymorphism.

5)
In java, method overloading can not be performed by changing return type of the method only. Return type can 
be same or different in method overloading. But you must have to change the parameter.
Return type must be same or covariant in method overriding.

Object Oriented Programming has great advantages over other programming styles: Code Reuse and Recycling: 
Objects created for Object Oriented Programs can easily be reused in other programs. Encapsulation (part 1):
Once an Object is created, knowledge of its implementation is not necessary for its use.

Code Reuse and Recycling: Objects created for Object Oriented Programs can easily be reused in other programs.
Encapsulation (part 1): Once an Object is created, knowledge of its implementation is not necessary for 
its use. In older programs, coders needed understand the details of a piece of code before using it (in this or another program).
Encapsulation (part 2): Objects have the ability to hide certain parts of themselves from programmers. This prevents programmers from
 tampering with values they shouldn not. 
Additionally, the object controls how one interacts with it, preventing other kinds of errors. For example, a programmer
 (or another program) cannot set the width of a window to -400.
Design Benefits: Large programs are very difficult to write. Object Oriented Programs force designers to go 
through an extensive planning phase, which makes for better designs with less flaws. In addition, once a 
program reaches a certain size, Object Oriented Programs are actually easier to program than non-Object
 Oriented ones.
Software Maintenance: Programs are not disposable. Legacy code must be dealt with on a daily basis, either 
to be improved upon (for a new version of an exist piece of software) or made to work with newer computers
 and software. An Object Oriented Program is much easier to modify and maintain than a non-Object Oriented 
 Program. So although a lot of work is spent before the program is written, less work is needed to maintain 
 it over time.
