Image result for linked list definition in java
A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object. Each element (
we will call it a node) of a list is comprising of two items - the data and a reference to the next node. 
The last node has a reference to null. The entry point into a linked list is called the head of the list.

Binary tree

left branch when greater and the right when less than the previous record.

HashTable
In computing, a hash table (hash map) is a data structure used to implement an associative array, 
a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index 
into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.
